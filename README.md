# Breakthrough-in-Understanding-Time
Reality emerges from programmable p-gluon geometry at Planck scale. Colossal structural energy (∼10¹¹³ J/m³) forms spacetime 'pixels', while minuscule activation energy (∼10⁻¹²³) drives observable physics. Time dilation equals rendering slowdown under geometric compression. Light speed is emergent from network dynamics, not fundamental postulate
